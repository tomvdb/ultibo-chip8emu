# ultibo-chip8emu
Proof of Concept for a Raspberry PI Bare Metal Chip8 Emulator using Ultibo (https://ultibo.org/)

Haven't touched Pascal in years so it's nasty, but the basics seem to work. This is a rough test, but the basic emulation works.

# todo:

1. support for all chip8 opcodes - **Done**
2. working keyboard input
3. faster graphics
